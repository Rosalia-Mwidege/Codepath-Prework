## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
I enjoy using:

Instagram

You can edit posts and comments

Other users are not notified when you search them up


Whatsapp

It is very convenient with all options for information to be shared 

Privacy option in terms of who views the status


Youtube

Keeps record of what you did not finish watching, 

Recommends similar videos


imessage

Just like whatsapp, you can even send money 

Deleting messages as soon as you send them

I hope to create an application where university students conducting business can share their products , ratings and connect with customers
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Using Xcode and Github for the first time was quite challenging but I understood how to use it through the videos.
