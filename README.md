## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
I enjoy using:
Instagram
You can edit posts and comments
Other users are not notified when you search them up

Whatsapp
It is very convenient with all options for information to be shared 
Privacy option in terms of who views the status

Youtube
Keeps record of what you did not finish watching, 
Recommends similar videos

imessage
Just like whatsapp, you can even send money 
Deleting messages as soon as you send them

I hope to create an application where university students conducting business can share their products , ratings and connect with customers
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Using Xcode and github for the first time was quite challenging but I understood how to use it through the videos.
